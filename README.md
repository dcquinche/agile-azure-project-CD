[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/odluser243333/AgilePipelineProject/_apis/build/status%2Fdcquinche.agile-azure-project-CD?branchName=main)](https://dev.azure.com/odluser243333/AgilePipelineProject/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=main)

# Overview

This project consist in building a CI/CD Pipeline. In the first part we are going to do it with Github Actions along with a Makefile, requirements and application code, and then, we are going to integrate this with Azure Pipelines using the Flask web framework.

## Project Plan

* [Spreadsheet with the project plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AZy8BwaYCT0HxbYKhldTA_-8TKOAm92wgtCDIUKcAoE/edit?usp=sharing)



* [Trello board for the project](https://trello.com/invite/b/jmY7G3FV/ATTI339b43e25439fcfcf3b77369c7da1cee2D90A971/final-project)



## Instructions

<TODO:
* Architectural Diagram (Shows how key parts of the system work)>

<TODO:  Instructions for running the Python project.  How could a user with no context run this project without asking you for any help.  Include screenshots with explicit steps to create that work. Be sure to at least include the following screenshots:

* Project running on Azure App Service

* Project cloned into Azure Cloud Shell

* Passing tests that are displayed after running the `make all` command from the `Makefile`

* Output of a test run

* Successful deploy of the project in Azure Pipelines.  [Note the official documentation should be referred to and double checked as you setup CI/CD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/ecosystems/python-webapp?view=azure-devops).

* Running Azure App Service from Azure Pipelines automatic deployment

* Successful prediction from deployed flask app in Azure Cloud Shell.  [Use this file as a template for the deployed prediction](https://github.com/udacity/nd082-Azure-Cloud-DevOps-Starter-Code/blob/master/C2-AgileDevelopmentwithAzure/project/starter_files/flask-sklearn/make_predict_azure_app.sh).
The output should look similar to this:

```bash
udacity@Azure:~$ ./make_predict_azure_app.sh
Port: 443
{"prediction":[20.35373177134412]}
```

* Output of streamed log files from deployed application
